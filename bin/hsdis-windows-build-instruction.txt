 How to build hsdis-amd64.dll and hsdis-i386.dll on Windows

    Install Cygwin. At the "Select Packages" screen, add the following packages (by expanding the "Devel" category, then clicking once on the "Skip" label next to each package name):
        make
        mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core (only needed for hsdis-amd64.dll)
        mingw-gcc-core (only needed for hsdis-i386.dll)
    Run the Cygwin Terminal. This can be done using the Desktop or Start Menu icon created by the installer, and will create your Cygwin home directory (C:\cygwin\home\username by default).
    Download the latest GNU binutils source package and extract its contents to your Cygwin home directory. At the time of writing, the latest package is binutils-2.22.tar.bz2. This should result in a directory named binutils-2.22 (or whatever the latest version is) in your Cygwin home directory.
    Download the latest OpenJDK source package and extract the hsdis directory (found in openjdk\hotspot\src\share\tools) to your Cygwin home directory. At the time of writing, the latest package is openjdk-7u4-fcs-src-b22-02_may_2012.zip. This should result in a directory named hsdis in your Cygwin home directory.
    In the Cygwin Terminal, enter cd hsdis.
    To build hsdis-amd64.dll, enter make OS=Linux MINGW=x86_64-w64-mingw32 BINUTILS=~/binutils-2.22. To build hsdis-i386.dll, enter make OS=Linux MINGW=i686-pc-mingw32 BINUTILS=~/binutils-2.22. In either case, replace 2.22 with the binutils version you downloaded. OS=Linux is necessary because, although Cygwin is a Linux-like environment, the hsdis makefile fails to recognize it as such.

The DLL can now be installed by copying it from hsdis\build\Linux-amd64 or hsdis\build\Linux-i586 to your JRE's bin\server or bin\client directory.

Note that binutils and OpenJDK use incompatible licenses. As I understand it, this means that it is legal to combine them for personal use, but not to distribute the result. Because of this, I cannot provide prebuilt DLLs.

Bonus tip: if you prefer Intel ASM syntax to AT&T, specify -XX:PrintAssemblyOptions=intel alongside any other PrintAssembly options you use.
